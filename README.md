Kalman Filter Implementation in C++ 

Available motion models for Constant Velocity (CV) and Constant Acceleration (CA).

# Build

This project can be built like an usual CMake project

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..

The `kalman_filter_main.cpp` is an exemplary application of the Kalman Filter. 

CMake generates an executable in `build/src` called `kalman_filter`.
